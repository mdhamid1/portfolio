<p>Unfortunately 3 people from my family contracted covid almost three weeks ago. As such, I was busy taking care of them and have not been able to focus on school much. It has already been discussed with the professor that the mobile view submission will be waived for me. 
However, I would be happy to peer review other students’ work.<p>
